 <span id = "worlddescription"> The map above represents the amount of total aircraft incident
	 happened and how they are distributed around the world.

<h2> Time Distribution</h2>

	 <span id ="graphdescription">Recent years have been considerably safer
for aviation, with fewer than 50 incidents every year between 2013 and 2016, compared
to as many as 141 as recently as 2006. Over 10 incidents happened in eight of twelve
months in 2006.
<br/>
Annual fatalities have been less than 1000
since 1996. And we can see a trend of decreasing fatalities in recent years.

		Boeing, the largest aircraft maker has the

		of total happened incidents. Other companies as McDonnell Douglas, Airbus,
		Embraer and Bombardier take up 15.5%, 11.7%, 6.69%, and 5.39% respectively. This
		data can only give you’re a brief description of relation between incidents and
		aircraft makers. However, this does not necessarily mean Boeing 737 is more likely
		to crash than any other aircraft. An accident rates graph would be more
		accurate. We cannot provide further graph due to the lack of data.

		 Aircraft accident also have some relationship with the flight phase.
		 Taxing and taking off contribute the most to the aircraft accident with a total of 187 count.
		 Landing and cruising also have a large percentage.
		 Accidents are distributed evenly among climbing, approaching, standing and descending,
		 which is about 100 cases on average. The phase that is having the least cases is maneuvering and
		  some unknown phases that is not recorded. The graph shows that the starting point and
			ending point are the most dangerous phases for aircraft.
